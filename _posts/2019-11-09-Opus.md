As you may know from my previous post [The Quest To Finding A Project], I've been looking for an open source project to work on. The purpose is to find something within an application that could be optimized, and eventually get my optimization on the upstream. On my search, I came around [xiph.org], a non-profit that supports and develops free and open protocols. They have helped develop and maintain multiple audio codecs, such as [FLAC], [Vorbis] and [Opus], that are used across multiple applications like VoIP, multimedia and games. The reason I decided on Opus is because it is their most recent codec and is currently used in [Discord], [Mumble] and [TeamSpeak], all of which I've used at some points in my life on almost a daily basis, and as I mentioned on my [previous post][The Quest To Finding A Project] I wanted to find something that I actually have experience using.

## What is Opus?

Simply put, Opus is a modern audio codec designed primarily with audio data transmission over the internet in mind. It can handle a different rage of uses like VoIp, music streaming, video conferences and general non-realtime music distribution. It is able to support all of these use cases by integrating the [SILK] and [CELT] codecs, which allows it to utilize a low bit-rate narrow band for speech and automatically scale to a higher quality stream seamlessly when required. It differentiates itself from other high quality codecs ([Vorbis], [AAC]) by having a lower delay and at the same time it supports a higher audio quality unlike commonly used low delay codecs ([GSM], [Speex]). 

Because it was designed for the internet, Opus is very robust and adaptable. It allows for a wide range of over 1200 bitrates, and it permits the bitrate to be variable so that the connection quality does not disrupt the communication. Thus, it is already highly optimized for most of its use cases but there may be more to be done due to the ever-changing nature of hardware architectures.

## Why Opus?

Well, for me, seeing that it is a fairly recent codec and that it is used by applications that I have experience with is a huge motivator to want to work on it. In addition, I believe that standards designed specifically for the web need to be as optimized as possible so that the most number of users can adopt them. At the same time, with the speed technologies move, constant adaptation is needed for standards to maintain their relevance, lest we want to end up with one more standard.

Although Opus has ben standardized, it is only in reference to its decoder. The reference encoder may still continue to change, and improvements are encouraged by the developer team. Which is what brings me to my next point.

## How may Opus be optimized?

Now that I have established why I chose Opus as my project, it might be a good idea to go over what I think my approach will be. My plan is to do a profiling of the encoder to see where time is being spent, then I'll attempt to see if there are any optimizations that can be applied to the functions where the encoder spends most of its time. 

Optimizations may be defined as porting a block of code to an specific architecture, for example if a function has been optimized for x86_64 but not on AArch64 then I'll look into why this could be, if there may be a solid reason behind, like it already is as optimized as it could be, or it is because no one has yet taken the time to make changes. Considering Opus has been in development for over a decade, there is a chance these things have already been done for most architectures but by just looking through the [Opus FAQ] it seems AArch64 has not been taken into consideration as there is no reference to it. However, that may just be a case of the wiki being out of date or simply they are explicitly including it as part of their definition of ARM. 

So the next step for me will be to look if there are any changes that could be made to the optimizations that have already been done, and if they can be optimized any further. It'll be necessary to keep in mind the accuracy of the encoding, as well as one of its primary purposes which is the compression of data. Optimizations that improve the time it takes to encode a bit stream at the cost of increased file size may not be worth it. The opposite is also true, which means the purpose of my optimization will have to be either reduction of time or size of the encoded stream while maintaining data accuracy and not affecting the other factors.
