In my [SPO 600] class we have been asked to find an open source project that could use some performance improvements. This is proving to be a bigger challenge than previously anticipated. There are thousands of open source projects, thus there are equally thousands of opportunities for optimizations, which is great. However, being able to notice where improvements can be made is difficult and the large number of potential projects is overwhelming. I dislike being overwhelmed with a seemingly infinite number of options as it often leads to a lack of focus and facilitates procrastination. In order to manage the task, I have come up with a plan that will, hopefully, help me find a project to work on.

In order to reduce the overwhelming amount of open source projects available I decided to implement some rules, these may seem very limiting but I need to narrow it down to maybe just a few hundred or less possibilities to make it manageable. My rules to searching for a project are:

1. Familiarity with the language
2. Active community, preferably on GitHub.
3. Regularly use the package either directly or indirectly

At the beginning of my search I had consider any package in a C-like language, but that was not a good idea. Most of the popular languages are C-like, and though I'm familiar with C and C++, the intricacies of other languages are completely unfamiliar to me and it may happen that a concept is able to work faster in one language than in another due to things like compiler optimizations.

Secondly, Git is possibly the most common version control system, and GitHub has the largest number of collaborators and open source projects. Furthermore, I have been using Git and GitHub since I learned about them a few years ago and have integrated them as part of my workflow, not only for coding but pretty much all of my school work. Another great thing about GitHub is the Issues which might be a great place to start looking for optimization possibilities.

Lastly, It'd be hard to work on an open source package without knowing what purpose it serves and even harder without personal experience using it. Most of the software I already use is open source, so I think looking at optimization opportunities within these packages sounds more appealing and may even benefit me in some way.

With these rules in mind I have narrowed down my search to a couple dozen packages, which is a lot more manageable and I feel more confident in being able to find something to work on.
