title: A Look Into Open Source Contributions

We were asked, as a part of [Lab 1](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/SPO600_Code_Review_Lab), to look at a couple of Open Source projects and find out what the contribution workflow looks like from start to finish. I decided to take a look at two projects, [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) because it is my most used editor right now and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) since I'm using it to build this site.

### VSCode

It is easy to confuse Visual Studio with VSCode, both are from Microsoft and the UI looks somewhat similar. However, they are vastly different software. Although VSCide can be used as an IDE, it is really intended to be more of an overpowered editor. On the other hand Visual Studio is a fully fledged IDE, and as such it is a much heavier program. 

The other big difference is the fact that VSCode is an open source project. Yes, even though it is backed by Microsoft anyone can help make it better. 

The first thing I noticed when checking out the VSCode Repo is that it is a massive project. Over 50,000 commits, almost 200 pull requests and more than 900 contributors. It has pretty much daily commits to its master branch, and although it looks like there are a couple of main contributors there appears to always be someone making a one off pull request. If contributing is what you are after, well there are nearly 6,000 issues open so there might be something that can get done at any one time.

Now that we have explored the size of the project and seen that they are open to new contributions lets find out how we can go about contributing.

I'm not sure if it is because the project is backed by Microsoft or just my inexperience but if there's something I love about VSCode is its [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). It is very detailed without sacrificing readability, unlike other editors that you almost need to learn a new language just to understand their docs. It comes as no surprise to me that there's an entire section on their [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki) dedicated to [Contributions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

##### How to contribute to VSCode

So on the VSCode wiki they let us know that there are different ways of contributing, from reporting bugs to making suggestions, as well as actually submitting pull requests. It appears as if anyone can take on any of the available issues, though they tell us that if we're trying to make a significant change we must discuss it with someone who has been assigned to overlook that issue. By taking a look at some of the issues it seems like this is where Microsoft employees come into play as they appear to be the ones who get assigned the main issues.

The wiki can walk you through the entire process of setting up a developer environment and what needs to be done, so I'm not going to do it here. I'm more interested in finding out what communication channels they use to report and track issues, and what the whole contribution process looks like.
