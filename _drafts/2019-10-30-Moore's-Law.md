In 1965 [Gordon Moore] observed that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the invention of integrated circuits. He then predicted that this trend would continue for another ten years. In 1975, he went back and revised his prediction to doubling every two years. We call this observation Moore's Law.

Moore's prediction has held mostly true until recent years. Since the early 2000's the doubling has been slowing down significantly, and most experts now predict that the famous law will be obsolete by 2025. We tend to take the increase in processing power over time for granted, but the possibility of solving hard problems by just waiting for a faster processor is something that most users of super computers no longer have.

## Why infinite doubling is impossible

One of the reasons Moore's Law is about to end is that manufacturers are already pushing the limits at current transistor sizes. As we get closer to atomic sizes the laws of physics begin to become a bit more fuzzy and it gets harder to get consistent results, which increases research costs.

CPU manufacturers are like every other business driven by profits. If the research becomes prohibitively expensive and the
