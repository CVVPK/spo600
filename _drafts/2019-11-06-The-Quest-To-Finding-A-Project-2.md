The Story So Far...

The path lies in front of him, though he cannot see it clearly, dark smoke still covers it and the truths he seeks remain hidden. Our hero has chosen one of the narrowest paths from the infinite number the mage offered him. He thought by doing so, the rest of his quest would be simple, but he was mistaken. The smoke has not lifted itself, and time has started to speed up just as the seer warned him it would. He knows he is now in the correct path that will lead him to The Project, his conviction in his ability to fullfil the quest remains unshaken. He plans to consult the the all knowing, the all seeing, the whatever else you want to call it, "The Google".

## The Googling

The Google, solemn as it always is, looks down upon our hero and asks the simplest question of all "Do you feel lucky?".

"No", he says.
"I wish to find The Project"

"But how do you expect to do such a thing, if not by Feeling Lucky", The Google responds.

Our hero, confident that inside this limiting path lies the answer to his quest, says "You will help me find it in The GitHub".

"Ok, give me 0.5 seconds", says The Google, willing to help as usual, even if his results are worse than useless.
"I've found 1,750,000 possibilities"

"Well, that doesn't help much, let me look at some of them anyhow", our hero knows not to look further than the first page of the manuscript, lest he wishes to go mad once again. Last time he had so many options was when he first met the mage, such a long time ago, yet it seems as if it was only a week past.

He needs to hurry, there is not much time left, and the faith of The SPO rests in him finding "The Project". Where he not to find "The Project", hundreds of hours would be wasted, the amount of lives that could be lost is unimaginable, he better stop thinking about this and get back to the task at hand. Getting past the smoke will not be easy, the oracle told him. "The Google may only make it thicker, be wary of its deceit", the oracle had warned him, yet our hero believed The Google would have the answer.

Our hero, now worried he had made things worse, looked at the first page of the manuscript. What he found were not the answers he wished to see but the ones he needed to see. His mouth made the slightest of smirks, unnoticeable to any mortal, yet The Google had seen it.

"Well, have you found what you wanted?", The Google asked.

"No, I have found something even better".

## The GitHub lifts the smoke

What he had found thanks to The Google was that there were ways The GitHub may be able to lift the smoke that has halted his progress.
